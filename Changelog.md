# Changelog

## v0.28 - Fri Jun 28 14:05:48 2024 -0700

### Bug fixes

- Fix NFS export id caching

### Bug fixes

- fix nil dereference in v0.26

## v0.26 - Mon Jun 17 11:06:17 2024 -0700

> [!WARNING]
> The Prometheus collector crashes in this release; use v0.27 instead which contains a fix for this issue

### Bug fixes

- Fix handling of pinned workloads for Prometheus
  - Pinned workloads are a special workload type
  - The Prometheus code did not understand this workload type and so it dropped the stats with an error
  - The fix now retains pinned stats and adds a new tag to all regular stats named "pinned" value "true" or "false"

> [!IMPORTANT]

### Major changes

- Major config rewrite
  - This config change means older config files must be updated to be compatible
  - Renamed back end names (removed "_plugin")
  - Removed hacky "processor_args" inherited from the Python collector
  - Added config stanzas for InfluxDB and Prometheus

## v0.18 - Sat Oct 28 15:18:39 2023 -0700

### Security

- Updated all dependencies to latest versions

### Bug fixes

- Restored missing "isilon" namespace from stats
  - In the switch to using our own Collector interface rather than the pre-canned gauges, the metric names lost their namespace prefix

## v0.17 - Thu Oct 26 13:26:06 2023 -0700

### Bug fixes

- Reworked Prometheus support
  - The initial Prometheus support had a major issue where stats that had been collected at least once, but which did not appear in the current collection cycle were still exposed via the `/metrics` endpoint
  - Completely rewrote the code. Advantages of the rewritten code include
    - the collector now correctly exports the original metric timestamp for each metric, and
    - the collector now expires metrics based on the metadata that defines how long they are value so stale metrics correctly disappear from the `/metrics` endpoint

## v0.16 - Mon Oct 2 12:56:59 2023 -0700

### New features

- Added support for NFS export id to path lookup
  - Optionally enabled via the config file.
